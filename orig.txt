Scientists may be one step closer to a cure for the common cold. They aren’t fighting the viruses that cause the infection. Instead they’re looking to make human cells — the hotel rooms in which viruses reproduce — an unwelcome place.

Viruses can’t reproduce on their own. They must hijack the machinery in cells to do that. So they temporarily infect those cells to make more of themselves. Then they explode open their host cell. This releases huge quantities of new infectious viruses.
