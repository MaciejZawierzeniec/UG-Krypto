y recently taught a gaggle of intelligent artificial agents  bot
s  to play hideandseek not because they cared who won the goal w
as to observe how competition between hiders and seekers would d
rive the bots to find and use digital tools the idea is familiar
 to anyone whos ever played the game in real life its a kind of 
scaleddown arms race when your opponent adopts a strategy that w

ew better plan its the rule that governs games from chess to sta
rcraft ii its also an adaptation that seems likely to confer an 
evolutionary advantageso it went with hideandseek even though th
e ai agents hadnt received explicit instructions about how to pl

ive themselves an advantage the hiders for example learned to bu
ild miniature forts and barricade themselves inside the seekers
